        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love this recipe because it's taken me so long to actually get a good tasting noodle and not just a good tasting piece of cheese on top. This recipe was just trial and error and it's really really good in my opinion. I'm really looking for feedback on this recipe. Thanks so much! This is really good even days after for leftovers. The cheese remelts and the flavor really sets in. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
